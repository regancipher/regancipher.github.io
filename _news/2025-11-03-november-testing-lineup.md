# On the Bench: November Testing Lineup

It's been a busy month getting new gear in for testing. Here's what's currently on the measurement rig and what you can expect to see reviewed soon.

## Currently Testing

### Moondrop Blessing 3 Dusk
The collaboration everyone's been asking about. Initial impressions are strong - this might be the best tuned IEM under $400. Full measurements and listening tests underway. Expect the full review mid-November.

**First Impressions:**
- Bass extension is excellent
- Mids are more forward than standard Blessing 3
- Treble is smoothed out nicely
- Comfort is top-notch

### FiiO K19
Their new flagship DAC/amp combo. The specs on paper are impressive - curious to see how it performs in real-world use. Early testing shows clean power delivery and very low noise floor.

### QCY H4
Follow-up to the H3 I reviewed last month. They've addressed some build quality complaints. Testing ANC performance against the previous model and competitors.

## Coming Soon

I've got some Chi-Fi IEMs arriving next week that have been making waves on Reddit. Also expecting a few budget TWS models that claim to punch above their weight.

## Codec Deep Dive Coming

Planning a comprehensive article on Bluetooth codecs - LDAC vs aptX Adaptive vs LC3. Lots of misinformation out there, so I want to tackle this with actual measurements and blind testing.

What are you most interested in seeing tested? Let me know!

**Quick Takes:**

🎧 **Best value right now?** Still the QCY H3 for under $50. Nothing comes close.

💰 **Worst price-to-performance?** Certain "audiophile" cables. You know the ones.

🔥 **Most overhyped?** Several "gaming" headsets charging premium prices for mediocre sound.
