# About Me

## From the Decks to the Desk

Before I was analyzing frequency responses, I was creating them. I spent years as a DJ and music producer, which gave me an intimate understanding of how music should sound and what makes audio equipment truly special.

## My Review Philosophy

**Measurements + Listening = Complete Picture**

I believe great audio reviews need both objective measurements and subjective impressions. That's why every review includes:

- 📊 **Comprehensive frequency response measurements** using professional equipment
- 🎧 **Extended listening tests** across multiple genres and use cases
- 📈 **Comparison graphs** against similar products in the price range
- 💰 **Value assessment** - not just "is it good?" but "is it worth the price?"

## My Measurement Setup

All frequency response measurements are captured using:
- **Measurement Rig:** [Your specific equipment]
- **Compensation Curve:** [Your target curve, e.g., Harman IE 2019]
- **Database:** Interactive [Squiglink-based measurement viewer](/measurements/)

Every measurement is repeatable and follows consistent methodology for fair comparisons.

## Testing Process

### 1. Initial Impressions (Days 1-3)
Fresh ears, stock configuration, first reactions to build quality, comfort, and out-of-the-box sound.

### 2. Measurement Phase (Day 3-5)
Multiple measurements for consistency, comparison against target curves and competitors.

### 3. Extended Listening (Week 1-2)
Daily use across different genres, volumes, and sources. Testing durability, comfort over time, and versatility.

### 4. Final Analysis
Synthesizing measurements and impressions into recommendations for specific use cases and listener preferences.

## What I Review

- 🎧 **Over-ear & On-ear Headphones**
- 🎵 **In-Ear Monitors (IEMs)**
- 🔌 **DACs & Amplifiers**
- 📦 **Audio Accessories**

I focus on gear between $20-$500, where most people make their purchases and where value matters most.

## Review Ethics
