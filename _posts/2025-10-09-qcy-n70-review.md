## Introduction

QCY dominated many of my early reviews with a string of budget releases along their journey from busy OEM to where they are today - a consistent presence in the budget TWS market that is capable of standing on their own two feet - and they're no longer just 'cheap and acceptable'! With releases like the MeloBuds Pro showing their commitment to offering feature-rich products at aggressive price points, the next logical step for QCY was to improve the sound, since for me, it had taken a step backwards slightly from their excellent LCP driver release, the precursor to the MeloBuds Pro, the HT05.

The N70 is their latest flagship, and they've continued the theme of packing the buds full of features, but they've also chosen to pair a MEMS driver with a dynamic driver, aiming to improve those grainy trebles on the MeloBuds Pro and give you more precision and faster transients to boot.

At just around £35, the N70 is positioned as an exceptional value proposition. The sound has certainly improved, and whilst some features remain more reliable than others, it's still their most polished product yet and not altogether unexpected nor unforgivable given the price.

The N70 competes directly with not only other MEMS options like Creative's Aurvana series, SoundPEATS' Capsule3 Pro and forthcoming Air5 Pro+, but other dual-driver alternatives such as Moondrop's planar-equipped Golden Ages 2, Realme's Buds Air 7 Pro and OnePlus Buds 4, and it certainly holds it own, although as always, the decision over whether it should be a guaranteed purchase is a little more nuanced.

## Design, Fit and Comfort

<div style="text-align: center; margin: 2rem 0;">
    <img src="/assets/images/reviews/qcy-n70/4.jpg" alt="Design" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;">
</div>

The N70 differ somewhat from the MeloBuds Pro in terms of both fit and design. As with seemingly most stem-based offerings these days, the rounded shoulder approach of Apple's AirPods Pro is out-of-fashion, with brands favouring a more angular finish at the top, presumably to accommodate touch controls and feedback microphones to augment calls and ANC. It's only a subtle difference in the case of the N70, balancing practicality and looks fairly well compared to something like Moondrop's Golden Ages 2, which stick out a little too much at the top.

</div>

The finish of the buds - glossy on the outer edge - means they are - in a similar vein to their lookalike the Redmi Buds 6 Pro - a bit of a fingerprint magnet. The medium-sized oval nozzles - again something of a trend among stem-based earbud designs - ensure a fairly secure albeit shallow fit. Whilst they passed the 100 jumping jacks test without any issues, their over-reliance on the thicker eartips to provide the traction in the ear would sometimes result in the buds thinking they were not seated, and as a result de-activating Active Noise Cancellation, before the adaptive mode realised and then kicked back in. I've seen a few moans about the ANC not being effective - and I suspect this is why, because when the buds are properly seated and an effective seal is present, they cancel more noise than their predecessor.

</div>

I put the N70 through the 100 jumping jacks test and they managed to get to 100 - just - although as sometimes happens with this sort of TWS, this was achieved by 'sizing down' from the eartip that gave me optimal ANC performance. This again comes back to the design brief of using thicker eartips to provide the traction - it gives the best seal for ANC, but not necessarily the best fit for exercise. If you find yourself in the same position, well, at least you know what to do! They're IPX5 btw - again great to see QCY certifying their sets, FWIW.

### The Case

<div style="text-align: center; margin: 2rem 0;">
    <img src="/assets/images/reviews/qcy-n70/6.jpg" alt="Case" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;">
</div>

The immediate and most striking observation about the N70 is the massive improvement in the charge case - from practicality to build quality - over their previous releases. In contrast to the MeloBuds Pro, the N70 no longer feels like a toy, and is compact and robust, belying the lowly price tag. It also offers the option of wireless charging, which takes a little longer than wired, but is a convenience that should only be celebrated.

</div>

I mentioned in the cons section above that the layout of the case is slightly counter-intuitive, with the stems standing back-to-back and the tips facing outwards. I guess this is a subjective observation because it will depend on what you're used to, but I've seen it mentioned by a few users so it felt worthy of mention. The space on the outside is limited, meaning third party eartips may not fit - a shame, because as we've established, there's a fairly good chance you'll need them.

## Audio & Sound Signature

<div style="text-align: center; margin: 2rem 0;">
    <img src="/assets/images/reviews/qcy-n70/graph_1.png" alt="Frequency response" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;">
</div>

You don't need to be an audiophile with an intimate understanding of FR to understand what QCY were trying to do with the sound here. It's a typical QCY-tuning - forget about neutrality and reference-style presentations, the N70 exhibit your archetypal v-shape consumer-style sound with a sub- and mid-bass elevation, some way above the Harman target, before tucking the lower midrange to try (unsuccessfully!) to minimise bleed, with a fairly flat midrange up to the presence region where we see vocals brought forward to balance the boom, before some treble extension flexes the MEMS driver to add that fully-expected extra shimmer. This sound profile should come as no surprise to past QCY buyers, because it's only really a very minor variation on what they've done previously, and whilst it fixes one problem the MeloBuds Pro had, it introduces another, and will probably require you to tweak the sound slightly to get the desired effect.

The treble is definitely more detailed and represents a big step forward from the MeloBuds Pro, removing some of the metallic-ism and artifacts that were quite easy to hear. If you're not used to MEMS drivers, though, this change in timbre can be a little disconcerting, or at least require some internal self-regulation - in other words, you might need to get used to it for a bit as it will sound a tad, well, different. And whilst I get the design brief - that QCY boosted the bass to offset the extra treble to balance the sound out a bit - the result exposes a fundamental challenge with hybrid driver configurations where speed and character differ between drivers - and to the discerning ear, unfortunately this will take centre stage over power and precision. The MEMS driver, being solid-state in its origin, responds almost instantaneously to transient signals with minimal overhang, meanwhile, the dynamic driver handling the bass has physical mass that needs to move back and forth, creating inherent inertia. This means bass notes linger slightly longer than they should, with a bit of bloom and decay that extends beyond the initial attack.

When you've got trebles that snap into place with precision while the bass is still settling from the previous note, the result is a low-end that feels a step behind - not always a problem, but when combined with that super-fast MEMS driver delivering cymbals and hi-hats with razor-sharp definition, it can leave the different frequency ranges sounding a little disattached, almost like the whole band isn't quite playing in the same room together. It's the sonic equivalent of having a drummer with impeccable timing paired with a bassist who's slightly behind the beat.

    <img src="/assets/images/reviews/qcy-n70/9.jpg" alt="App EQ" style="width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;">
    <img src="/assets/images/reviews/qcy-n70/Customise4.png" alt="Custom EQ" style="width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;">
</div>

This alignment issue is something I don't really want to dwell on too much, because for many users they won't notice nor care, and will probably welcome the boom if my observations on audio hangouts like the earbuds subreddit are anything to go by, but if you are in the camp that is left slightly dissatisfied, thankfully it doesn't take too much tinkering to get the most out of this effective budget setup, although in truth I had more success using Wavelet for this because whilst the QCY app is feature-rich, it seems to do things to the sound that it isn't showing you, to the point I pretty much gave up on it.

Focus should be on trimming that thunderous lower frequency presentation that overawes instruments and vocals, and making adjustments at 2kHz, 8kHz and beyond. I've shared my initial EQ and perhaps you could use this as a starting point. Much of this section has focused on what the sound of the N70 doesn't do, but after making these quite subtle adjustments, you reveal a horizontal presentation and sharper imaging that is clearly a leap from the constrained sound of its predecessor, obviating the timing issues to deliver a fun, energetic sound that is bigger on macrodynamics than microdetail - a Saturday night set, but probably one to leave alone on Sunday mornings.

It sees the N70 take pride of place as the best performing in its' price category in my Audio League Table, scoring similarly to more expensive contemporaries, including OnePlus Buds 4, Realme Buds Air 7 Pro and SoundPEATS' Air5 Pro, although it's probably worthy of one final mention that they require a little more customisation than those aforementioned options to really get the best out of them - basically, you're saving money for possibly even better sound, but you'll likely have to work a bit for it.

## Controls & Features

If you're someone who values features and functions, well QCY have them in abundance, although the delivery of these features can lack finesse, to say the least. The control customisation is practically limitless, allowing you volume control with a single tap. It's touch controls as opposed to physical buttons, but they are fairly straightforward to use and I didn't struggle too much with accidental touches. There's a 'find my' device feature, which although I'm not exactly thrilled at the prospect of sharing my constant location data with an app which looks like it was thrown together pre-vibe coding. Still, if remembering what you've done with the your earbuds is of paramount importance, the option is there, and there's loads of other nice little features like channel re-balancing (if your hearing is better in one ear, for example), setting disconnection and power-off timers (for those who use their earbuds to drift off to sleep - note, the shape doesn't make these particularly useful for side-sleepers) and the ability to adjust the beep volume and update firmware, although in their latest release, trying to do this causes the app to crash on all of the Android devices I tested it on.

There's also fit detection, wear detection and wind noise detection. The first of these options tells you whether you've got a good deal, the second allows you to macro certain actions (remove an earbud and sound will pause, pause and resume when reinserted or neither, for example, or switch off ANC). The final one - search me - I've not seen this through QCY previously, and when testing in the wind I didn't notice any real discernible differences.

The N70 are, I believe, the first QCY set to support Google Fast Pair integration, so within Android settings you can easily and quickly see how much battery is remaining and switch between your different active noise cancellation modes. This gives you some basic functionality without the travails of using or installing the app - which you may well come to appreciate.

The N70 offers multi-point connectivity and gaming mode. When it comes to latency, the N70 actually does pretty well, even with gaming mode switched off, registering 157ms and dropping down to 66ms with gaming mode activated. This is more than satisfactory for light gaming and streaming videos, and doesn't impact too much on battery life.

On the other hand, taking advantage of hi-res codecs - notably LDAC -  support, but for the negligible improvement you get in sound, personally I'd stick to AAC. Sets with more complex driver arrangements are typically more power hungry. Even switching ANC on and turning the volume up had a massive impact on single use playtime.
QCY gives you extra personalisation in the form of a hearing test, but it was a bit clunky and didn't give me particularly good results.

With ANC off and AAC, and using the H3 at a low volume, I could just about get over 5 hours playtime, but with ANC on it dropped to 3 hours 45 even on AAC. It's not unusual for this kind of driver setup to be power-hungry, but for users who value long uninterrupted listening sessions, even the quick charge feature of 2 hours extra juice from 10 minutes in the case might not be enough to save the H3.

## ANC & Transparency

The H3 delivers consistent, mid-tier ANC performance that benefits from the deeper fit and resulting passive isolation compared to previous SoundPEATS offerings. In real-world testing across busy coffee shops and subway environments, it performs adequately without reaching the heights of stronger performers like the Soundcore Liberty 4 NC or Realme Buds Air 7 Pro, which cut more low end rumble from typical outdoor scenes.

Transparency mode was surprisingly competent, outperforming some more popular options like the Earfun Air Pro 4 and Soundcore Liberty 4 NC. I was able to hold clear conversations in shops without difficulty, hearing most words clearly. This represents a genuine improvement over older budget offerings. SoundPEATS offer a 'vocal mode', but it seemed to do little compared to offerings from the likes of QCY, where voices are not only enhanced, but surrounding sounds are also muted somewhat. The H3 also handle wind noise adequately, although stronger gusts will see some reverb through the mics.

## Call Quality

Call performance is adequate but not exceptional. The H3 gets the job done across various environments, but voice clarity and noise reduction fall short of premium offerings like the Huawei FreeBuds Pro 4, which uses bone conduction mics and benefits from the closer proximity derived from a stem-design.

In busier environments, the noise reduction algorithm steps back a little, prioritising your own voice, which can sound a touch raspy. Quieter indoor calls work better, with more consistent voice reproduction. The ability to switch to ambient mode during calls through the app helps mitigate some of the isolation issues.

## Summary

![Final thoughts](/assets/images/reviews/qcy-n70/8.jpg)

The SoundPEATS H3 doesn't shirk its priorities - it delivers genuinely well-rounded technical audio performance that rivals products at significantly higher price points, particularly in its imaging and soundstage capabilities, that surpasssed my expectation in a mid-budget true wireless offering.

But for those seeking a set of all-rounders, this technical strength comes wrapped in compromises. I can accept a bit of EQ intervention since sound is largely subjective, and a good driver selection and combo will encourage EQ tweaking rather than see it as detrimental. I can also accept a slightly bulky design given the need for a battery, SOC, mics, etc. Not every user will, though. SoundPEATS probably could have benefited from a more Harman-esque default sound profile, whilst still facilitating those features that a lot of buyers will prioritise. The short battery-life, in particular, will put people off, given so many people these days can't seem to tolerate ten minutes of real life! As a result of these shortfalls, the H3 becomes more of a niche set that will be attractive to some, but aren't a guaranteed shoe-in purchase.
