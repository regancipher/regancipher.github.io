---

The QCY H3 enters an increasingly crowded budget ANC market at just $45, promising "studio-quality sound" and "advanced noise cancellation." Bold claims for such a modest price tag.

I've spent two weeks daily-driving the H3 across flights, commutes, and extended listening sessions. This review combines measurements from my GRAS 43AG measurement rig with real-world impressions to see if QCY's latest can compete with headphones twice its price.

**TL;DR:** The H3 delivers genuinely impressive ANC and surprisingly balanced sound for $45. Build quality is the clear compromise—there's noticeable creaking and the plastic feels cheap—but if you can look past that, there's serious value here. These outperform several $100+ competitors in noise cancellation and match them in sound quality.

## What's in the Box

The QCY H3 arrives in minimal eco-friendly packaging. Inside you'll find:
- The H3 headphones
- USB-C charging cable (no wall adapter)
- 3.5mm aux cable for wired use
- Carrying pouch (thin fabric, not a hard case)
- Quick start guide

The accessory package is sparse but includes everything you actually need. The fabric pouch offers basic protection for throwing these in a bag.

## Build Quality & Comfort

### Build

Let's address the elephant in the room: these feel cheap. The matte black plastic housing creaks audibly when adjusting the headband, and there's noticeable flex in the ear cups. Nothing feels like it's going to break immediately, but I wouldn't want to toss these in a backpack without the carrying pouch.

That said, the hinges are metal and feel robust, and the padding is surprisingly nice quality—soft memory foam covered in breathable protein leather. The headband has ample adjustment range and clicks positively into place.

### Comfort

Despite the budget build, comfort is excellent. At just 220g, these are lighter than most budget ANC headphones. The clamping force is moderate—enough to maintain seal for ANC without causing hotspots. I wore these for 4+ hour sessions without discomfort.

The ear cups are spacious enough for most ears, though those with very large ears might experience some touching. Isolation is good even with ANC off thanks to the thick padding.

### Controls & Features

Physical buttons on the right ear cup control everything:
- Power/pairing (long press)
- Volume up/down
- Play/pause/skip (center button)
- ANC mode cycling

The buttons are tactile and easy to find by feel. I prefer physical buttons over touch controls for reliability, especially with gloves.

The QCY app (iOS/Android) is functional but basic:
- 3-band EQ (bass/mid/treble sliders)
- ANC mode selection (ANC/Transparency/Off)
- Battery indicator
- Firmware updates

That's it. No customizable button mapping, no advanced EQ, no spatial audio gimmicks. Honestly, it's refreshing.

**Battery life** is exceptional: 60+ hours with ANC off, 35+ hours with ANC on. USB-C charging takes about 2 hours for a full charge.

## Sound Quality

### Frequency Response

[Link to your measurement graph or embed it]

The QCY H3 follows a pleasant consumer-friendly tuning with elevated bass, slightly recessed mids, and controlled treble. It's close to a mild V-shape without being overly colored. Compared to the Harman target, there's about 3dB more sub-bass and a slight dip around 2-3kHz.

### Bass

Sub-bass extends cleanly down to 30Hz with solid authority—impressive for Bluetooth headphones, especially at this price. The mid-bass has good punch without bloating into the lower mids. Texture is decent; you can distinguish between different bass instruments, though it's not as refined as higher-end models.

**Tested with:**
- Billie Eilish - "bad guy" - Sub-bass hits hard with clean impact, doesn't overpower the vocals
- Kendrick Lamar - "HUMBLE." - Kick drums have authority, bass line stays textured
- Hans Zimmer - "Time" - Low orchestral rumble has weight without muddiness

Bassheads will be happy here. The bass is prominent but controlled—it enhances music without dominating it. Even at higher volumes, the bass stays reasonably tight.

### Mids

The midrange has a slight 2-3kHz recession typical of consumer tunings, which pushes vocals and guitars slightly back in the mix. Male vocals sound natural and full-bodied. Female vocals are slightly less forward than I'd prefer but never sound veiled.

**Tested with:**
- Adele - "Hello" - Vocals sound rich, though not as intimate as neutral headphones
- John Mayer - "Slow Dancing in a Burning Room" - Guitar tone is pleasant, slightly warmed
- Norah Jones - "Come Away With Me" - Smooth presentation, good for extended listening

Instrument timbre is surprisingly good. Acoustic guitars sound convincingly woody, and piano notes have decent weight. It's not reference-level accuracy, but it's well-tuned for enjoyment.

### Treble

Treble extends reasonably to about 12kHz before rolling off. There's a small peak around 8-9kHz that can occasionally make cymbals sound a bit splashy at higher volumes, but it's not fatiguing at normal listening levels.

**Tested with:**
- Steely Dan - "Aja" - Cymbals have good shimmer, slight emphasis but not harsh
- Daft Punk - "Get Lucky" - Hi-hats are crisp, treble stays controlled during busy sections
- Classical strings - Violins have decent air without sibilance

Detail retrieval is good for closed-back Bluetooth headphones in this price range. You can hear subtle background details, though don't expect studio monitor levels of resolution.

### Technicalities

- **Soundstage:** Modest width typical of closed-backs, but decent depth. Not congested, instruments have space to breathe.
- **Imaging:** Center image is solid. Left/right separation is clear, though precise positional cues aren't as sharp as higher-end models.
- **Detail:** Good for the price. Micro-details are present if you listen for them, though not as immediately obvious as in more resolving headphones.
- **Dynamics:** Decent punch and impact. Not the most dynamic headphones, but tracks have energy and life.

## Active Noise Cancellation

This is where the H3 genuinely impresses. The ANC performance rivals headphones costing $100-150.

**Tested environments:**
- Airplane cabin: Blocks most engine drone, slight pressure sensation but not uncomfortable
- Subway train: Reduces rumble by ~85%, conversations mostly muted
- Coffee shop: Background chatter significantly reduced, focused work easily achievable
- Street noise: Traffic and wind noise substantially diminished

The ANC doesn't completely eliminate all sound (nothing at this price does), but it's remarkably effective for the cost. There's minimal pressure feeling, no excessive hiss in quiet environments, and music sounds natural with ANC engaged.

**Transparency mode** is functional but not great—it amplifies ambient sound but sounds slightly digital and overprocessed. Good enough for quick conversations, but not something I'd leave on constantly.

## Use Cases

### Who Should Buy This?

**Best for:**
- **Budget-conscious commuters** - Exceptional value if you need ANC for public transit
- **Students** - Great for library study sessions, long battery life means infrequent charging
- **Casual listeners** - If you just want good-sounding wireless headphones without breaking the bank
- **Travel on a budget** - ANC performs well enough for flights at a fraction of typical prices

**Skip if:**
- You need premium build quality for rough handling
- You're a treble-sensitive listener (that 8-9kHz peak might bother you)
- You want advanced app features and customization
- You need the absolute best sound quality regardless of price

## Final Verdict

The QCY H3 is a remarkable achievement at $45. Yes, the build quality feels budget, and there are minor tuning quirks. But the core experience—sound quality, ANC performance, comfort, and battery life—punches well above its price class.

These outperform several headphones costing 2-3x as much in noise cancellation, and match them in sound quality. If you can accept the plasticky build, the H3 represents some of the best value in budget wireless ANC headphones right now.

At this price, the compromises are entirely reasonable. QCY has prioritized the aspects that matter most—the listening experience—and delivered.

**Rating: 8.2/10**

*The QCY H3 proves that excellent ANC and good sound quality don't require a three-figure budget.*
